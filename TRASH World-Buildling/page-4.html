    <h2>Words of Affirmation: 30%</h2>
    <p>
    Words of affirmation are words that communicate your love, appreciation, and respect for another person. They're positive words and phrases used to uplift someone. What's more, these compliments and words of encouragement don't have to be said directly to the person. A simple hand-written note is appreciated just as much as a personal phone call.

    <br>People who give and receive love through words of affirmation tend to be the people who notice and care about the details of other people's lives. For instance, they may be the first to notice their partner's new haircut. They also remember to ask the neighbor how their sick dog is doing. They may even remember to ask the cashier at the local supermarket if they are feeling any better.

    <br>By using words of affirmation in your relationship, you are strengthening communication between you and your partner. You are showing your partner that you notice and appreciate them. When your partner feels appreciated, they are likely to experience a deeper satisfaction with themselves and with the relationship.

    <br>Receiving words of affirmation can help someone feel a greater sense of self-worth and motivation as well. If you notice your partner is making an extra effort on a special project or on their appearance, you might offer them an encouraging word or some praise. They will likely feel a boost in spirit and appreciate you for noticing.

    <br>Offering your partner an encouraging word can have a positive impact on you, too. Studies link giving compliments with a greater sense of well-being.
