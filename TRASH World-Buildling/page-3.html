    <h1>ESFJ Weaknesses</h1>
    <span class="bolded">Too Selfless</span> – The other side of this is that Consuls sometimes try to establish their value with doting attention, something that can quickly overwhelm those who don’t need it, making it ultimately unwelcome. Furthermore, Consuls often neglect their own needs in the process.
        <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
        <br><span class="bolded">Worried about Their Social Status</span> – These Strengths are related to a chief Weakness: Consuls’ preoccupation with social status and influence, which affects many decisions they make, potentially limiting their creativity and open-mindedness.
        <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
        <br><span class="bolded">Often Too Needy</span> – Consuls need to hear and see a great deal of appreciation. If their efforts go unnoticed, people with the Consul personality type may start fishing for compliments, in an attempt to get reassurance of how much they are valued.
        <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
        <br><span class="bolded">Vulnerable to Criticism</span> – It can be especially challenging to change these tendencies because Consuls are so conflict-averse. Consul personalities can become very defensive and hurt if someone, especially a person close to them, criticizes their habits, beliefs or traditions.
