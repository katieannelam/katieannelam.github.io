        <h1>How Do You Deal With Intrusive Thoughts?</h1>
        <h2>No Stupid Questions: Stephen J. Dubner & Angela Duckworth</h2>
        <p> DUCKWORTH: So, in this experiment, what Dan Wegner asked participants to do is to just speak out loud. Like, talk through their thoughts — just let the stream of consciousness flow. And the key in this experiment is that, in the treatment condition, he asked them not to think of a white bear.

            DUBNER: And weren’t they supposed to ring a bell or something if they thought of the white bear?
            <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
            <br>DUCKWORTH: He had two ways of measuring how often these intrusive thoughts — in this case, a white bear — barge into the living room of your consciousness. He had them ring a bell if they thought it, because he wasn’t sure whether people would really be able to verbalize everything in their stream of consciousness. But he also had them talking. And whether you just note in the transcript or by the number of bell rings, what you find is that people are really bad at not thinking of a white bear. And, in fact, when you ask them to not think of a white bear, then they think of a white bear, of course, way more than if you never asked them to not think of a white bear. So, that’s the paradox of thought suppression.
            <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
            <br>DUBNER: So, let me ask you this. If I’m thinking about pushing someone in a pool, or worse: into the path of an oncoming train, pushing someone off the top of a building — should I instead just think about a white bear, and that will get me off that intrusive thought?
            <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
            <br>DUCKWORTH: Well, yes! And the reason I say that is that it was found that one way to not think of a white bear is actually to actively think about just anything else. Like, think about, you know, eggs and ham. “Eggs and ham. Eggs and ham.” And then, your mind is going off in a totally different direction. So, yeah. If you want to not think about something, you actually do have to focus your attention on something else. That’s one way to get yourself to not have intrusive thoughts. But I think, actually, a deeper solution is something that comes all the way back to obsessive-compulsive disorder. Really, what is causing people distress from these intrusive thoughts isn’t exactly just the thoughts themselves, but this kind of secondary, like, “Oh, no. Now, I have this unwanted thought. Oh, wait. No! I thought about it again!” And, in a way, the answer to this is to accept intrusive thoughts. Say you’re trying to focus on your breathing, and you’re trying to be present in the moment. And then, what keeps intruding on your consciousness are your worries about work. And what sometimes is recommended in these mindfulness practices is, like, it’s like as if a cloud has passed over the sun. Instead of being like, “Oh no, I’m thinking about the future!” — you just gently let the cloud pass by the sun. So, there’s an acceptance that, in a way, is the escape route out of this thought-suppression stress — “Oh, my gosh, now I’m thinking about it even more”— cycle. And the reason I say it’s related to O.C.D. is that the “obsession” part in obsessive-compulsive, that refers to the thoughts, and the compulsion is usually the behavior. So, some would argue that the problem in this pathology is not that you have intrusive thoughts, because everybody has them, but there is this reaction to your own thoughts that’s the problem.
