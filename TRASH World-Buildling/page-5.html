    <h1>â™¥ Language: Acts of Service</h1>
    <h2>Words of Affirmation: 27%</h2>
    <p>For those whose primary love language is acts of service, they will appreciate the tactile, palpable steps you are taking to enhance or simplify their life by making it a little bit easier. When they don't have to worry about the little but big things that give them stress, it allows them to fully show up as a partner and reciprocate love from a place of abundance. 
        <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
    <br>They feel your adoration by the things you do. Actions that go above and beyond help them feel your love towards them. They can be things like mowing the lawn, doing the dishes, or getting up in the middle of the night to take care of the little one, letting you sleep. Anything that can make your partner feel appreciated or that can help make their life easier.
    <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
    <br>At its core, this language is about demonstrations of love. Their actions are actually less about the deed itself and more about showing you that they are on your team.
