    <h1>♥ Language: Quality Time</h1>
    <h2>Words of Affirmation: 23%</h2>
    <p>In Quality Time, nothing says “I love you” like full, undivided attention. Being there for this type of person is critical, but really being there and present makes you feel truly special and loved. Distractions, postponed activities, or the failure to listen can be especially hurtful. Whether itʼs spending uninterrupted time talking with someone else or doing activities together, you deepen your connection with others through sharing time.

    <br>Perhaps more than most, people who communicate in this love language never lose sight of the fact that time is a finite resource and that every minute is irreplaceable. They view time as a priceless gift they want to give and receive in relationships, and although they appreciate expressions of love in other languages, alternate types of affection aren’t considered as meaningful as time together.
        <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
    <br>Put simply, quality time means you really enjoy spending time where you are focused on your partner and your partner is totally focused on you. Quality time isn't just being physically present in the same space as your partner. It's engaging and being intentional about how you spend that time bonding and strengthening your connection with a meaningful conversation or learning a new skill together.
