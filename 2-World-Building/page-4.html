    Stair accident statistics are some of the highest injuries listed each year – both in the USA and abroad. In a 2017 study written in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine, it was found that every year, there is an average of over one million injuries that come as a result of falling down the stairs. As the second leading cause of accidental injury in the country, it’s a statistic that can’t be ignored.

    <br><br>Reviewing falling down stairs injury statistics uncovers even scarier information: every year there is an average of 12,000 deaths as a result of a stairway accident. Showcasing just how dangerous stairs can be in every environment, it indicates the importance of following the correct practices. 
    
    <br><br>Interestingly, many believe that it’s only older individuals that primarily fall down the stairs. And although a high portion of those in the study were older adults, the highest statistic (67.2%) found that it was a combination of these people, along with younger children.
