    <h1 id="title">Spicy Garlic Butter Linguini</h1> 
    <p id="description">You know me and fusion foods, especially pastas–it’s an absolute passion of mine! (❁´◡`❁) <br> This winning dish is quick, incredibly delicious, and makes maximum use from minimal ingredients.</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>200g (7 oz) linguine or spaghetti</li>  
    <li>75g unsalted butter</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
    <li>2½ tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>2½ tbsp oyster sauce</li>
    <li>3 tbsp finely grated parmesan cheese, plus extra to serve</li>
    <li>2 tbsp finely sliced spring onions (scallions)</li>
    <li>4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>6 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>To make the garlic oil, place the oil and the garlic in a small saucepan over medium heat. Once the garlic is sizzling, cook for 2-3 minutes or until the garlic is just starting to turn golden at the edges. Transfer to a heat-proof bowl and set aside for later (the garlic will continue cooking and turn evenly golden in the bowl).</li>
    <li>Heat a large pot of salted water over high heat. When boiling rapidly, add the pasta and cook until al dente.</li>
    <li>While the pasta is cooking, add the butter, garlic and chilli flakes into a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook stirring until the butter is just melted (you want the garlic to soften but not colour), then add the soy sauce and oyster sauce. Simmer for a minute and then take off the heat until the pasta is cooked.</li>
    <li>When the pasta is al dente, reserve a cup of pasta cooking liquid in case you need it later. Place the butter sauce back on the heat and add the pasta straight into the pan. Cook, stirring, for 3-4 minutes or until the liquid has been absorbed by the pasta and everything is looking super glossy and thick. Toss through the parmesan cheese (add a little pasta cooking water here if necessary). Divide among serving plates. Top with a drizzle of garlic oil and some garlic chips. Sprinkle with spring onion and add extra cheese.</li>
    </ol>
