    SANTOS: You must turn about this distinction because it fits with some of the other work done on moral psychology to write like in the context of its called trolley problem. So so what's a trolley problem and give me an example of the kind of most famous one that we tend to use in psychology and philosophy yeah yeah. So I think in general there are different ways that we can make a decision, and so these sorts of trolley cases that we ve used as cognitive probes to understand rural cognition, highlight this distinction between a got reaction. That says: do this or don't do this and thinking in terms of costs and benefits on a large scale. So in one version of the trolley problem, the trolley is headed towards five people and you can hit a switch.
    <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
    That will turn the trolley away from the five people and are putting on a side tracked, but there's one person there, and so that person will be killed and, if you ask me was it, is it ok to hit the switch to minimize the number of deaths? Most people say that that's fine, then there is the footbridge case where the trolley his head again headed towards five people, your oughta footbridge over that acts in between the oncoming trolley and the five, and the only way to save those five people is to do something. It feels really awful. There is this person wearing, let's have a giant backpack standing next to you and you can push them off of the footbridge and no land on the tracks and they'll be killed by the trolley, but it'll stop the trolley from killing the fight, People inevitably say that it's wrong, or at least feels very wrong to train one life for five and the footbridge case. So what is going on there? So I am and other researchers, since I spent a lot of time looking at people's behaviour and reaction times and brains. So we have this when we called dual process dynamic, where
