<h2>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck: Mark Manson</h2>
<p> 
    The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a book that challenges the conventions of self-help by inviting the reader to NOT try, say no often and embrace negative thinking. Not giving a f*ck is about being comfortable with being different and caring about something more important than adversity.
    <br>You must give a f*ck about something.

<h2>The Five Big Ideas</h2>
<p> Conventional self-help advice focuses on what you’re NOT. Further, it zeros in on what you perceive your personal shortcomings and failures to already be, and highlights them for you.
    <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
    The key to a good life is not giving a f*ck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.
    <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
    <br>When you feel angry about feeling angry or anxious about feeling anxious, you’re stuck in what Manson calls, “The Feedback Loop from Hell.”
    <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
    <br>However, by not giving a f*ck that you feel bad, you short-circuit the Feedback Loop from Hell; you say to yourself, “I feel like s*it, but who gives a f*ck?”
    <p style="font-size:0.5px;line-height:0.15;"></p>
    <br>Because there’s an infinite amount of things we can now see or know, there is also an infinite number of ways we can discover that we don’t measure up, that we’re not good enough, that things aren’t as great as they could be. And this rips us apart inside.
